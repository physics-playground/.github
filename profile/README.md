This is the home to various implementations of real-time physics engines. Each fork is expected to be almost identical to original but with a few changes:

* Added CI support with GitHub actions.
* Build and run scripts in the root of each one to allow anyone to easily build.
* Support for Windows, Linux, and macOS by default for developers.
* Editor configuration files for VSCode, CLion, and PyCharm where appropriate.
